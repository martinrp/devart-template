<h1>The interactions</h1>
The installation is about observing the interactions between each of the elements of the piece to create a dynamically evolving work that rewards engagement and play.

<h2>Interaction with the audience</h2>
When moving under the projection a trail of shapes will appear, increasing the level of motion detected. These objects can then be manipulated and controlled by the users with their motion. For example they could be collected into a ball and then thrown across the projection to another group of objects.

<h2>Interaction with graphics</h2>
When a group of objects collide with another set of shapes they will interact, this could be by colliding and scattering, or by joining with that groups motion into a formation potentially using the Boids artificial life / flocking algorithm.

<h2>Interaction with sound</h2>
When the object are created they will be linked with a certain frequency range of the music playing. The program will look for peaks in the frequency and link this with a selected animation. The style and type of object will also be linked to these frequencies, so that similar objects are being used for, bass, midrange and treble.

<h2>Interaction with the artist</h2>
While the focus of the project is promoting user interaction and observing emergent behaviour,  another interaction which we aim to explore when we move this project beyond the prototype phase, is that between the artist as a conductor of this behaviour. 

The artist or another conductor will be able to manipulate the visuals which are produced using a Leap Motion controller linked to the installation. By moving their hands in three dimensional space in front of the Leap Motion, a different sets of visuals, and the animations and behaviour which they follow can be manipulated corresponding to the three axises and the number of fingers used. This should also be a natural process and reward experimentation.
